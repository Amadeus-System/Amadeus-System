# Computational Physics Researcher & AI Developer

## Who Am I?

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I have a **Master's degree in Computational Physics**.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m have worked on **Benchmark Study of Graph Neural Networks related to Halide Perovskite**.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m have learned **Density Functional Theory (DFT) with VASP**, **D-Wave Quantum Annealing** and **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**. 
- âš¡ I'm interested in **Artificial Intelligence**, which means that I would like to observer the very special moment when the true-intelligence born.
- âš¡ I'm very interested in **Theretical Physics**, **Computational Optimization** such as Many-body Schrodinger Equation in quantum-theory and 
- âš¡ I'm currently working as an AI researcher for my company, which is related to real-world anomaly detection for image, video, timeseries information.
