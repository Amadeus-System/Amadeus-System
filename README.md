# Computational Physics Researcher & AI Developer

## Who Am I?

- ðŸ‘‹ I have a **Master's degree of Applied Physics**.
- ðŸ”­ I have worked on **Benchmark Study of Graph Neural Networks related to Halide Perovskite** for High-throughput Material Screening with Deep Learning.
- ðŸŒ± I have learned **Density Functional Theory (DFT) with VASP**, **D-Wave Quantum Annealing** and **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**. 
- âš¡ I'm interested in **Artificial Intelligence**, which means that I would like to observe the very special moment when the true-intelligence is born in the universe.
- âš¡ I'm very interested in **Theoretical Physics** such as Many-body Schrodinger Equation in Quantum Field Theory.
- âš¡ I'm currently working as an AI researcher for my company, which is related to real-world anomaly detection for image, video, timeseries information.
- âš¡ Currently-progressing personal project : Library analysis, Study about Deep Learning, Computer Science, etc.
